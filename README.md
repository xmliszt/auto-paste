# auto-paste
Auto Paste is an experimental web application that allows non-Apple user to copy &amp; paste across various devices. For example, when the user open the Auto Paste app on his/her phoen, he/she can copy text or images anywhere on the phone, and then paste it on his/her computer, given that he/she has an instance of Auto Paste web application running on the computer's browser. The first idea will be trying out via web application for both mobile and laptop/PC, on browsers. Subsequently, might try to implement natively for Android and iOS separately.
